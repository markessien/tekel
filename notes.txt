Problems to be solved


Questions to be answered:
 - Can ML be used to automatically discover the data-type based on a string


API Structure
-------

- Objects exist
- These Objects have attributes
- These objects exist in lists



A) Simple structuring and understanding
Problem 1: identify if a particular list of objects is the same as another list. I.e list A1 may contain 
only some items that are in list A2, but seeing the overlap will tell that it is actually the same list


B) Finding data type
Problem 2: Look at the features of an object and discover the data type


C) Understanding what each column is based on how it looks or interacts. This is agnostic to the data type, e.g I could have a column with Dog, Black. They are both strings on the low-level, but they actually represent a more abstract type.

- We need a list of information labels. Each feature is mapped to that label. E.g Dog = Animal and Black = Color.

- To discover which label it belongs to, sample items can be entered in.

Label:
    - setExpectedDataTypes(string, int)
    - setColumnHeaderSamples(list)
    - setRelationshipWithAnotherLabel(LabelName, AddsTo, VeryStrict) (SubtractsFrom, IsEqual)
