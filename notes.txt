Problems to be solved


Questions to be answered:
 - Can ML be used to automatically discover the data-type based on a string


API Structure
-------

- Objects exist
- These Objects have attributes
- These objects exist in lists



A) Simple structuring and understanding
Problem 1: identify if a particular list of objects is the same as another list. I.e list A1 may contain 
only some items that are in list A2, but seeing the overlap will tell that it is actually the same list


B) Finding data type
Problem 2: Look at the features of an object and discover the data type


C) Understanding what each column is based on how it looks or interacts. This is agnostic to the data type, e.g I could have a column with Dog, Black. They are both strings on the low-level, but they actually represent a more abstract type.

- We need a list of information labels. Each feature is mapped to that label. E.g Dog = Animal and Black = Color.

- To discover which label it belongs to, sample items can be entered in.

Label: <- we use a different name, this is already an ML term
    - setExpectedDataTypes(string, int)
    - setColumnHeaderSamples(list)
    - setRelationshipWithAnotherLabel(LabelName, AddsTo, VeryStrict) (SubtractsFrom, IsEqual)

With the label method, we do not need to auto-discover data-type, except in the context of the above classification.


- We need a way to tell the classifier that the work it did was correct or wrong. It should then use this to learn.


At the end, we have a list with every item labelled. We know the data types of the labelled items and we have a formula how we convert from the info there to a valid data type.


- We have the functionality to merge lists of objects together

ObjectList
   - isThisTheSameList
   - addListWithoutDuplicates(timelineLabel=)

On Debit-Credit project, we want every line to clearly indicate what it's all about.

Each line can be:

    - An inflow from a customer
    - A transfer betweeen bank accounts
    - An outflow to a supplier
    - A payment to a staff (salary, expenses or the like)

We have a list of sales made. Each inflow should be compared to the list of sales to see if it matches. Each inflow also needs to be compared to the list of transasctions on other bank accounts to see if it matches. 

We need to map features that are going to be the same across both lists.

Searching for a pattern in another list based on an object in the other list

ObjectList:
    findObject(x.label1 similarTo y.label2 and x.)
    matchToAnotherList(x.label1 similarTo y.label2 and x.label3 similarTo x.label4)

For marketing
- you have a list of ads, with all the associated numbers being features
- we want to know when an ad is no longer profitable
- we could set a threshold for feature combinations?
- Each object can hold a time series of it's state.
- You should be able to say that if an object will become not profitable in the next 3 days, you turn it off
